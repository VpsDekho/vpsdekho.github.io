                    If you do not trust us, that's not a problem because we have our own customers who believe
                    in us
                    and gave us a chance for the first time. Now, those customers are our regular clients. So,
                    try
                    us out first, and then believe in our services.<br><br>

                <div class="answer">
                    We do not sell carded items; we sell genuine products directly from data centers.<br><br>

            <div class="question">
                For outbound traffic, inbound traffic, and the total bandwidth usage, how is it calculated?
            </div>
            <div class="answercont">
                <div class="answer">
                    The costs are calculated based on outgoing traffic only, not inbound traffic. For example,
                    if
                    your monthly bandwidth quota is 4TB, it is calculated as follows:
                    4TB/672hr(24hr*28days)=5.95GB/hr.<br><br>

                <div class="answer">
                    We have both IPv4 and IPv6. By default, all of our VPS have IPv4. If any users request IPv6,
                    we
                    can enable the IPv6 option.<br><br>

            <div class="answercont">
                <div class="answer">
                    By default, a clean OS is installed without these additional packages. However, you will
                    have
                    full root/admin rights to install any additional software you need. The application image
                    contains the corresponding environment; for example, the WordPress image contains PHP,
                    Nginx,
                    WordPress, and MySQL.<br><br>

                    <p>Customers are responsible for managing their VPS. They can do whatever they want with their VPS,
                        but abuse, use of
                        pornographic material, leeching torrents, or any use of copyrighted content is prohibited. If
                        the VPS gets suspended
                        or banned for these reasons, the provider is not responsible, and no changes or swaps of the VPS
                        will be provided.
                        Therefore, remember to consider the type of work you do with the VPS before using it. Support is
                        available only for
                        network issues, server hardware, and OS templates. We do not offer support for installing,
                        configuring, or debugging
                        applications.</p>
